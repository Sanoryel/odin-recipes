    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This simple recipe for a basic biscuit dough can be adapted to suit your tastes – experiment with different
        shapes and flavours, from lemon fingers to chocolate cookies</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g butter, softened</li>
        <li>140g caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>300g plain flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a wooden spoon, then add the egg yolk and vanilla extract and
            briefly beat to combine.</li>
        <li>Sift over the flour and stir until the mixture is well combined – you might need to get your hands in at the
            end to give everything a really good mix and press the dough together.</li>
        <li>For basic vanilla biscuits: Pre-heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Chill the dough for 20 - 30minutes,
            roll out and cut out shapes as above. Bake on a non-stick baking tray for 10-12 minutes until pale golden.
            Carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool and crisp up.</li>
    </ol>
